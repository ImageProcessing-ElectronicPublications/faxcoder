PDF: (default)
  want EOL EOL, resp. EOL(1?)x6
  do NOT need EOL after each line!!!
optionally allow 0 bits to align with byte boundary at line start. (check this)
  might allow resync to EOL for K>=0 (then: requires EOL after each line)
  
FOR US: check how to deal with reads 1 byte more


libtiff: 
  does not write RTC (6xEOL(1?)) in G3. (no EOL at end of file)

FOR US: to implement this we need to allow (*read) to return some kind of EOF


TIFF 6.0 Spec:
  never write EOL in G3 1d, (i.e. also no RTC)
  Strips are independent images

want?
 - pbm reader/writer (P1,P4)
... may want: 
 - simple tiff reader/writer
